General
=======

This is a Mender QA specific layer. The layer contains the necessary bits and
pieces for use with Mender CI pipeline.

Setup
=====

* S2 switch is pressed when powering on the device, the board should boot using
  MMC1 device, this will be visible in U-Boot banner:

      U-Boot SPL 2017.05 (Aug 07 2017 - 08:55:56)
      Trying to boot from MMC1


Test host
---------

* Use mender-image-test-host to build a test host image

* Test host image is running from eMMC (/dev/mmcblk1 aka `mmc dev 1` under U-Boot)

* When built, just dd the image onto the card, boot, once in the running system do:

     dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/mmcblk1 bs=1M

* Set MACHINE = "beaglebone-mender" device when building for test host.


Image under test
----------------

* Build normally, write *.sdimg to SD card


mender-qa integration
---------------------

* `mender-qa activate-test-image off` will add a uEnv.txt file to u-boot
  partition (1, vfat). The file sets up `uenvcmd` to boot from internal eMMC

* By default, the board will boot with test image
