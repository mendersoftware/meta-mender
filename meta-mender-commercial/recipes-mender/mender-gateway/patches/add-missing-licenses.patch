+YOCTO LAYER LICENSE FOR MENDER BY NORTHERN.TECH
+===============================================
+
+Thank you for choosing the Mender Yocto layer by Northern.tech (“**NT**”).
+The use of the NT open source and/or enterprise (closed source) software offered access to (linked) through the Mender Yocto layer (“**layer software**”) requires as conditions that you (or your organization):
+
+- a) has signed up for the appropriate **Hosted Mender** subscription or **Mender Enterprise** on-premise software (collectively, “**Mender**”)
+- b) accept the below software open source and closed source license terms and the terms of your Mender agreement (collectively, “**terms**”), and
+- c) accept the terms of any third-party software provided access to through the Mender Yocto layer.
+
+Governing law and legal venue are as stipulated in the Mender agreement under which your use of layer software and Mender takes place.
+
+CLOSED SOURCE LICENSE TERMS
+---------------------------
+
+### 1. Grant of License
+
+Subject to the conditions of the terms, NT grants you as a licensee and customer a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license during the term of your Mender subscription to use the object code form of the layer software for the business purposes of your entity. Such use must take place in accordance with the technical and user documentation made available by NT to its customers with regards to layer software (“**documentation**”).
+
+Layer software shall also include any documentation and any later releases of the layer software.
+
+### 2. Installation and Copies
+
+Customer may install the layer software only on computers and devices under its control and management for use only by its customers, its customer’s employees, required affiliates and contractors for as many devices as covered by your Mender subscription. Customer may also make a reasonable number of copies of the layer software for back-up and archival purposes.
+
+### 3. License restrictions
+
+Customer may not (and may not allow any third party to):
+
+- a) decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the layer software or attempt to reconstruct or discover any source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, file formats or programming interfaces of the layer software by any means whatsoever (except to the extent that applicable law restricts reverse engineering restrictions, and then only with prior written notice to NT);
+- b) distribute, sell, sublicense, rent, lease or use the layer software for time sharing, hosting, service provision or similar purposes;
+- c) remove any product identification, proprietary, copyright or other notices contained in the layer software; or
+- d) modify or create derivative work any part of the layer software or incorporate the layer software into or with other software, except to the extent expressly authorized in writing by NT.
+
+### 4. Limited warranty
+
+#### 4.1 Warranty period
+
+NT warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of download of the layer software (the “**warranty period**”), the layer software shall operate in substantial conformity with its documentation. NT does not warrant that customer’s use of the layer software will be uninterrupted or error-free, will not result in data loss or that any security mechanisms implemented by the layer software will not have inherent limitations. NT sole liability (and customer’s exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty shall be, in NT’s sole discretion, to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide customer with an error-correction or work-around which corrects the reported non-conformity, to replace the non-conforming layer software with conforming layer software. If NT determines such remedies to be impracticable within a reasonable period of time, NT may terminate the applicable Mender agreement, and thus the license to layer software. Upon termination NT will refund the subscription fee paid for the non-conforming layer software. NT shall have no obligation with respect to a warranty claim unless notified of such claim within the warranty period.
+
+#### 4.2 Exclusions
+
+The above warranty shall not apply: (a) if the layer software is used with hardware or software not specified in NT documentation; (b) if any modifications are made to the layer software by customer or any third party; (c) to defects in the layer software due to accident, abuse or improper use by customer; or (d) to software provided on a no charge or evaluation basis.
+
+#### 4.3 Disclaimer
+
+Except as expressly set forth in this section 4 the layer software and all services are provided “as is”. Neither NT nor any of its suppliers makes any other warranties, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, title, fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement.
+
+### 5. Limitation of liability
+
+5.1 Neither party shall be liable for any loss of use, lost data, savings or profits, failure of security mechanisms, interruption of business or any other indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages of any kind regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise, even if informed of the possibility of such damages in advance. You will indemnify and hold us harmless for any claim based on negligence (tort), product liability or other strict liability related to devices you control or service.
+
+5.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of the terms, NT’s and its suppliers’ entire liability to customer shall not exceed the amount actually paid by customer to NT under your Mender  agreement under which use of the layer software takes place, during the previous six-month period preceding the incident giving rise to the loss.
+
+5.3 This section 5 shall not apply to customer with respect to any claim arising under the sections 1 - 3 above.

+
+   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
+
+   1. Definitions.

+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
